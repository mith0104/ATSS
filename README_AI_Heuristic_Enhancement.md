# AI-Based Heuristic Scanning Enhancement for Advanced Threat Scanner

## Overview
This enhancement integrates AI-based heuristic scanning into the Advanced Threat Scanner application using the Isolation Forest algorithm from scikit-learn. The scanner extracts features from files and uses the model to detect anomalous or suspicious files that may indicate threats.

## Key Features
- Feature extraction includes file entropy and frequency of suspicious strings.
- Isolation Forest model detects anomalies in file features.
- Integration with existing threat handling and logging.
- New scan type: Custom Heuristic Scan with AI detection.
- Requires scikit-learn and numpy dependencies.

## Installation
Install the required Python packages using pip:

```
pip install scikit-learn numpy
```

## Usage
- Launch the Advanced Threat Scanner application.
- Use the "Custom Heuristic Scan" button to select files for AI-based heuristic scanning.
- The scan will analyze selected files and flag potential threats based on anomaly detection.
- Review scan logs for detected threats and actions taken.

## Notes
- This is a basic AI integration for demonstration purposes.
- Further training and tuning of the model can improve detection accuracy.
- Ensure dependencies are installed before running the application.
